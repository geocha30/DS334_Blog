Moreover, it becomes apparent that spring records the lowest average number of duplicates among the seasons. This trend could be attributed to a variety of factors, including the predominant involvement of students during this period, who might be feeling overwhelmed due to academic pressures such as exams, leading to decreased participation in the game. Following spring, we observe summer, where the frequency of duplicates increases marginally compared to spring but remains relatively lower than in other seasons. This could imply a shift in engagement patterns during the warmer months, potentially reflecting a change in players’ priorities or activities. Lastly, autumn emerges with a moderate level of duplicates. As the year progresses, players might re-engage with the game, contributing to the insignificant uptick in duplicate occurrences."

Well, one area that’s been getting a lot of attention in social science research lately is the relationship between alcohol consumption and how we feel about our lives.\nAs society evolves and our lifestyles change, understanding how the consumption of alcohol affects the bigger picture of our happiness and well-being becomes super important. A commonly use measure of a country’s welfare is called “ladder scores”; it measures how satisfied people are with their lives. And figuring out how alcohol fits into this whole happiness equation can tell us a lot about ourselves and our society."

Despite its modest alcohol content, typically around 4.5%, beer remains a predominant beverage consumed in substantial quantities. In this part of our analysis, we’ll turn our attention to the top 20 beer-consuming countries globally. Within this group, we aim to uncover any discernible trends related to various societal indicators of well-being. More specifically, we are going to investigate possible association between beer consumption and a range of variables, including GDP per capita, ladder scores, and surprisingly, generosity.\n\ntop_consumers &lt;- alcohol_df |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) |&gt;\n  slice(c(1:24)) |&gt;\n  select(-1, -c(4:6))\n\ntop_consumers_data &lt;- left_join(top_consumers, world_hpi_df, by = c(\"country\" = \"Country name\"))|&gt;\n  remove_missing() |&gt;\n  mutate(country = fct_reorder(beer_servings, .f = country, .fun = max))\n\nFirst, we will focus on the variation in the ladder scores of each country within the top 20 consumers. Ladder scores, according to Research gate, is a metric used by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network to metricize the happiness of the citizens in a country.\n\nggplot(data = top_consumers_data) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = country, y = `Ladder score`), \n             color = \"darkblue\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x = country, \n                    ymin = lowerwhisker, \n                    ymax = upperwhisker), \n                color = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Country\",\n    y = \"Ladder Score\",\n    title = \"Relationship between Beer Consumption and Happiness\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"ivory\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"ivory\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), \n  )\n\n\n\n\nWith the x-axis ordering the countries based on their beer consumption from the lowest to the highest among the top 20 consumers, intriguing patterns emerge. Notably, Namibia (1st), Gabon (3rd), and Venezuela (7th) have the lowest ladder rankings among their counterparts, with a rating of less than 5. Countries in the middle of this list, including Poland, Germany, Romania, Belgium etc have somewhat similar ladder scores, around 6. This unexpected finding prompts further exploration into the relationship between beer consumption and societal well-being. Potential explanations may include cultural differences in the perception of happiness, varying levels of social support networks, and the influence of other socioeconomic factors that shape overall life satisfaction. Further analysis is needed to delve deeper the complex interplay between beer consumption and subjective well-being across diverse cultural contexts. This analysis involves the integration of other variables that are directly related to the ladder scores.\nMoving on, GDP-per-capita and generosity enter the discussion. According to the World Health Organization, GDP-per-capita is the GDP divided by the midyear population, where GDP is the total value of goods and services for final use produced by resident producers in an economy, regardless of the allocation to domestic and foreign claims. Generosity, within the context of happiness scores and rankings, is one of the six key factors shaping overall life evaluations, It covers the extent of kindness, altruism, and charitable actions among individuals in a given country, derived from Gallup World Poll data.\n\nggplot(top_consumers_data, aes(x = beer_servings, y = `Logged GDP per capita`, color = country, label = country)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_label(size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Beer Consumption vs. GDP per Capita\",\n    x = \"Beer Servings\",\n    y = \"Logged GDP per Capita\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"ivory\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"ivory\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(top_consumers_data, aes(x = country, y = Generosity)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Generosity Scores by Country\",\n    x = \"Country\",\n    y = \"Generosity Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), \n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"ivory\"),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"ivory\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nUpon analyzing the graphs with generosity alongside GDP per capita, several intriguing patterns come to light. As anticipated, countries like Venezuela, Gabon, and Namibia, which rank among the top 10 consumers of beer, exhibit lower GDP per capita figures compared to their counterparts. This aligns with the expectation that higher beer consumption may coincide with lower economic prosperity in certain regions. However, what emerges as particularly surprising is the prevalence of negative generosity scores across the majority of countries. This unexpected finding suggests that, despite variations in economic status, many nations exhibit tendencies towards lower levels of generosity, as indicated by the negative values. This disparity prompts further investigation into the underlying societal and cultural factors contributing to such trends, indicating the complex interplay between economic indicators, societal values, and individual behaviors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted interventions aimed at fostering a more equitable and compassionate global community."

Analyzing ladder scores, GDP per capita, and generosity scores among the top 20 beer-consuming countries unveiled nuanced connections. We found disparities in happiness levels among high beer-consuming countries, prompting further investigation into cultural and economic influences on subjective well-being. While higher beer consumption correlated with lower GDP per capita, the prevalence of negative generosity scores suggests complex societal dynamics. This analysis underscores the need for deeper exploration into the impact of alcohol on individual and societal welfare. Understanding these dynamics can inform targeted interventions aimed at promoting holistic well-being and fostering a more compassionate global community.\nWhile our analysis incorporates geographic coordinates to visualize distributions of alcohol consumption, it extends beyond mapping to encompass various visualizations that effectively communicate our findings. Through scatterplots and bar charts, we present insights into the variability and uncertainty inherent in our data. For instance, geom_errorbar in our scatterplot of ladder scores showcases the uncertainty in the measurement of happiness levels across countries. This approach allows us to express the range of possible values and the level of confidence in our estimates. By employing a diverse range of visualization techniques, we capture the complexity of the relationship between beer consumption and societal well-being, shedding light on patterns and trends that extend beyond traditional mapping approaches. This holistic approach enables us to convey nuanced insights while effectively communicating variability and uncertainty within the data."
